/*

You work for a real estate agent. As part of the redesign of the website, you must
create a Housing class which will have the following private properties :
- Title (string 3 to 80 characters)
- Area (int)
- City (string 3 to 10 characters)
- Type (string : house ou appartement)
- Price (int)


Create the getters/setters to validate the type of data above as well as the constructor to instantiate the class.

Add a getInfos() method allowing to return all the properties in the form of an array.
In a new file, instantiate the class in order to be able to display 3 different Housing objects
and display the result using the previously created getInfos () method.
