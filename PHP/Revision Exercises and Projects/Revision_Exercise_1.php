    Exercise 1 :

    We have an array of integers, positive, between 1 and $nbElements
    $nbElements is the number of elements.

    Write a function called 'FizzBuzz'.
    For each number 'n' of the list, we want the following operations :
        * If the number is divisible by 3 : display 'Fizz'
        * If the number is divisible by 5 : display 'Buzz'
        * If the number is divisible by 3 AND 5 : display 'FizzBuzz'
        * Else : display the number 'n'
