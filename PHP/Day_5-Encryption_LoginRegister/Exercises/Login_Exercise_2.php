    Exercise :

    This exercise is based on the 'Login_Exercise_1'.

    In this exercise, you'll have to create the register process.

    - Step 1 :
        Create a register.php file
        This file contains a form with those input :
            * username
            * email
            * password
            * submit btn
    
    - Step 2 :
        If the form is submitted, you have to insert the new user in the DB.
        
        But first, you have to check :
            * username, mail and password must not be empty !
            * mail must be a valid one
            * password must be hashed

        Display a different message for each validation/error.

    - Step 3 :
        If everything is good, insert the new user in the DB !

    - Step 4 :
            Edit the login.
            Now the login should verify if the password match the hash one !!

            Be carefull, your old users dont have a hash password.
