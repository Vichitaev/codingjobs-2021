    Exercise :

    Write a recursive function that display all numbers from $x to 0

    $x can be any value.
    If $x is already 0 or lower, you still have to display the number once.

*/

/* 
    Bonus (only if you have time) :

    Write a recursive function that calculate the multiplication of two numbers using only the addition.

    Example : 
        4*3 = 4+4+4
