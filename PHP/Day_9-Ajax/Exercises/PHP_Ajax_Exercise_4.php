    -- Exercise : 

    This exercise is based on Ajax_Exercise_1.

	- Step 1 :
		You should change 'movies.html' and 'get-movies.php'
        They should use JSON to exchange data now.

        'movies.html' still display the same resul (all the movies).
    
    - Step 2 :
        Let's implement some filters.
		On the 'movies.html' page, create a dropdown to order by title (you can choose DESC or ASC).
        
        If you select a different value in the dropdown, it should change the content of the page and (re)order movies.
