AJAX : Asynchronous Javascript and XML

A classic web application transmits data from the server to the clien by "synchronous requests".

For example: the client access the page by its URL, and then receives a response from the server.
You can also receive data through a form.

With AJAX, you can, form example, make sure the form is valid (check every input) without the page being reloaded.
